        "verse_0": "In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.",
      "verse_1": "The sending down of the Book is from Allah, the Dignified, the Wise.",
    "verse_2": "Undoubtedly, We have sent down this Book to you with truth, therefore worship Allah being purely His devotee.",
    "verse_3": "Yes, the sincere exclusive devotion is to Allah only. And those who have taken for protectors other than Allah say, 'we worship them only so that they may bring us nearer to Allah'. Allah will decide among them concerning that wherein they are differing. Undoubtedly, Allah guides not him who is a great ungrateful liar.",
    "verse_4": "If Allah had willed to take a son for Himself, He would have chosen whom He had pleased out of His creation, Sanctity is to Him. He is Allah, the One, the All Dominant.",

    "verse_6": "He has made you of a single soul, then He made its mate from that and sent down for you eight pairs of cattle.

None is to be worshipped besides Him, then where are you turning away?",
    "verse_7": "If you be ungrateful, then undoubtedly, Allah is Independent of you, and He likes not the ungratefulness of His bondmen; but if you be thankful, then He likes it for you. And no soul bearing burden will bear the burden of another. Then you are to return to your Lord, and He shall inform you of what you used to do. Surely He knows the secrets of the hearts.",
    "verse_8": "And when any trouble touches man, he calls upon his Lord leaning towards Him, then when Allah grants him any favor from Himself, he forgets what he called for before and begins to assign peers to Allah so that he may lead astray from His way. Say you, 'carry on a little with your infidelity, undoubtedly, you are among the men of the Hell.'",
    "verse_9": "Will he who passes the hours of the night in devoted obedience, prostrating and standing fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of His Lord (be like disobedient)? Say you, 'Are those who know equal to those who know not'? Only those who are endued with understanding receive admonition.",
    "verse_10": "Say, 'O My Bondmen who believed, fear your Lord. There is good, in this world, for those who have done good. And Allah's earth is spacious. The steadfast shall only be fully rewarded without measure.'",

    "verse_18": "Who listen to the word attentively and follow the best thereof. It is they whom Allah has guided and it is they who possess wisdom.",
    "verse_19": "Will he then against whom the sentence of torment is decreed be equal to those who are delivered? Will you then rescue one deserving fire from your guidance?",
    "verse_20": "But those who fear their Lord, for them are lofty chambers, built over them lofty chambers, beneath which rivers flow. The promise of Allah, Allah breaks not His promise.",
    "verse_21": "Have you not seen that Allah has sent down water from the sky and then made springs in the earth thereof, then He causes to grow therewith crops of diverse colours, thereafter it dries up and see you that it turns yellow, then He breaks it into small pieces? Undoubtedly, in it is a reminder for men of understanding.",
    "verse_22": "Will he whose heart Allah has opened for Islam so that he is upon a light from his Lord be like him who is hard-hearted? Woe, then, is to those whose hearts are hardened from the remembrance of Allah. They are in evident error.",
    "verse_23": "Allah has sent the best Book that from beginning to the end is alike (in beauty and fairness), having twofold descriptions (promise of reward and threat of punishment) at which do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord, then their skins and hearts soften inclining towards the remembrance of God. This is the guidance of Allah. He guides there with whom He pleases. And he whom Allah causes to go astray, there is none to guide him.",
    "verse_24": "Will he, then, who will make his face a shield for the great torment on the Day of Resurrection be like him who has been delivered? And it will be said to the oppressors,' taste your earnings.'",
    "verse_25": "Those before them belied, so torment came upon them whence they knew not.",
    "verse_26": "Therefore Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world and the torment of the Hereafter is the greatest. What a good thing it would have been if they knew.",
    "verse_27": "And undoubtedly, We have narrated in this Quran all types of examples for the people in order that they may take heed.",
    "verse_28": "The Quran in Arabic language wherein there is no crookedness in order that they may fear.",
    "verse_29": "Allah sets an example, a servant belonging to several rude masters and one belonging solely to one master. Are they both equal in condition? All praise to Allah, but most of them know not.",
    "verse_30": "Undoubtedly, you are to depart, and they are too to die.",
    "verse_31": "Then on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute before your Lord.",

    "verse_34": "For them is what they desire with their Lord. This is the reward of the righteous.",
    "verse_35": "So that Allah may remove from them the worst that they did and recompense them with their reward for the best of their actions that they used to do.",
    "verse_36": "Is Allah not Sufficient for His bondmen? And they frighten you with those besides Him. And whom Allah lets astray, for him there is no guide.",
    "verse_37": "And whom Allah guides, for him there is none to mislead. Is not Allah the Honorable, the Master of Retribution?",
    "verse_38": "And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will then necessarily say, 'Allah'. Say you, 'tell me then that those whom you worship besides Allah, if Allah desired any affliction for me shall they then remove His affliction? Or if he desires mercy for me, could they with-hold His mercy? Say you, 'Allah is enough for me', in Him the trusting one put their trust.'",

    "verse_42": "Allah takes away the souls at the time of their death and of those who die not, during their sleep, then He withholds that against which He has decreed death and sends back the other till and appointed time. Undoubtedly in it are signs for those who reflect.",
    "verse_43": "Have they taken some intercessors besi6des Allah? Say you, what! 'Even though they own nothing, nor they do understand'.",
    "verse_44": "Say you, 'all intercession belongs to Allah'. 'For Him is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, then you are to return to Him'.",
    "verse_45": "And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter shrink, and when those besides Him are mentioned, henceforth they rejoice.",

    "verse_47": "If the wrongdoers had all that is in the earth and the like thereof in addition to it, they would have offered all of it as ransom from the evil torment on the Day of Judgement. But there appeared to them from Allah that which they never thought of.",
    "verse_48": "And their own earned evils became apparent to them and they were encircled by that which they used to mock at.",
    "verse_49": "And when any trouble touches man, he calls on Us, then when We grant him any favor from Us, he says, 'I have got it because of a certain knowledge.' Nay! it is only a trial, but most of them know not.",
    "verse_50": "So have said those who were before them, but all that they had earned did not avail them.",
    "verse_51": "So the evils of their earnings overtook them, and those who are unjust among them, they too shall be overtaken by the evils of their earnings and they cannot go out of control.",

Until when they shall reach it, its gates will be opened and its warders will say to them, 'Did not come to you from amongst you the Messengers who recited to you verses of your Lord and warned you of the meeting of this Day of yours?'
