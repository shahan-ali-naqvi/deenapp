  "verse_103": "And hold fast, all together, by the rope of Allah, and be not divided among yourselves. And remember Allah's favour upon you, when there was enmity among you, He joined your hearts together then, by His grace, you became brothers together and you were upon the brink of a pit of the Fire, then He rescued you from it; thus Allah explains to you His signs; that haply you may get guidance.",

  "verse_110": "You are the best among all those nations appeared unto mankind, you command to good, and forbid evil, and keep faith unto Allah. Had the people of the Book believed, then it was good for them. Some of them are Muslims and most of them are infidels.",
  "verse_111": "They will not harm you save annoying; and if they fight with you, they will turn their backs from you, then again they will not be helped.",
  "verse_112": "Ignominy has been pitched on them, wherever they are, they shall get no security save with a rope from Allah and a rope from men, (they may get protection). And they became worthy of the wrath of Allah and on them destitution has been pitched. This is because they used to reject the signs of Allah and slay the Prophets unjustly. This is because they were disobedient and transgressors.",
  "verse_113": "All are not alike. Among the people of the Book some are those who stand right, recite the signs of Allah in the hours of night and prostrate.",
  "verse_114": "They believe in Allah and the Last Day and command good and forbid evil and run for good works, and they are righteous.",

  "verse_118": "O believers! Do not make strangers as your confidents, they leave no stone unturned in harming you. They yearn for what distresses you. Hostility appeared from their utterances and what they have concealed in their breasts is yet greater. We have made you hear Our signs clearly, if you have wisdom.",
  "verse_119": "Behold, it is you who love them, and they love you not. Though you believe in all the Books. And when they meet you, they say, 'we accepted faith1, and when they are alone, then they bite their fingertips at you out of wrath. Say you, 'die in your passion'. Allah knows well the thoughts of the hearts.",
  "verse_120": "Anything good befalls you it vexes them; and if an evil befalls you, then they are happy at it, and if you have patience and fear Allah, then their guile will not hurt you at all. Verily, their all doings are under the circumference of Allah.",

  "verse_126": "And this victory Allah did not make, save for pleasing you and so that your hearts might get rest with it, and there is no help except from Allah, the Dominant, the Wise.",
  "verse_127": "In order that He might cut off a portion of the infidels or abase them, so that they may go back disappointed.",
  "verse_128": "This matter is not in your hand, whether He shows His graciousness to them for repentance or torment them, for they are unjust.",

  "verse_136": "For such the recompense is their Lord's forgiveness and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath, they shall remain for ever therein, and what an excellent reward is for workers.",
  "verse_137": "Some systems have already been experimented, before you, then see, going through the earth, how the end of the beliers was!",
  "verse_138": "This is to state to people and to guide and is admonition to those who are pious.",
  "verse_139": "And be not sluggish and neither be grieved, you are the very same who shall overcome if you have faith.",
  "verse_140": "If any distress has come to you, then they too have already received a similar distress. These are the days in which we have fixed turns for the people and that is because Allah may make one to distinguish the believers and may assign some of you the position of martyrs. And Allah loves not the unjust.",
  "verse_141": "And so that Allah may purify the Muslims and wipe out the infidels.",
  "verse_142": "Are you in this supposition that you shall enter the paradise and yet Allah has not tested your warriors and neither has experimented the steadfast?",
  "verse_143": "And you used to long for death before meeting it, so now you have seen it with your eyes.",
  "verse_144": "And Muhammad is only a Messenger. There have been many other Messengers before him. Will you then, if he departs or be slain, turn back on your heels? And he who will turn back on his heels, shall not harm Allah at all. And very soon Allah will recompense the thankful.",
  "verse_145": "And no soul can die save by the leave of God. The time of all is already recorded. And whoso desires the reward of the world, We give to him of this, and he who desires the reward of the Hereafter, We give to him of this, And it is very soon, We may recompense the thankful.",
  "verse_146": "And many a Prophet fought, with them there were many God- men, they fell not sluggish with the miseries they faced in the path of Allah, and neither became weak nor gave in. And the steadfast are dear to Allah.",
  "verse_147": "They did say nothing save this prayer, 'O Our Lord! Forgive our sins and our excesses that we committed in our affairs, and make firm our steps and help us against these disbelieving people.",
  "verse_148": "So Allah gave them the reward of the world, and goodness of the reward of Hereafter. And the good doers are dear to Allah.",
  "verse_149": "O believers! if you follow the line of infidels, then they will turn you upon your heels, and you will be back after losing.",
  "verse_150": "Whereas Allah is your Patron; and He is the best Helper.",
   "verse_151": "Soon We shall cast terror in the hearts of infidels, because they associated partners with Allah for which He sent down not any understanding and their abode is Fire, and what the evil abode of the unjust is!",
  "verse_152": "And verily, Allah did prove the truth of His promise to you when you were killing the infidels by His leave, until when you showed weakness and quarreled about the order and disobeyed after He had shown you the thing you desired for. Of you someone desired the world and of you someone desired the Hereafter, then He turned your faces from them that He might test you; and no doubt, He forgave you and Allah is Bounteous over Muslims.",
  "verse_153": "When you were going up and did not look back towards anyone and Our Messenger was calling you in another group; therefore He gave you sorrow in recompense for a sorrow, and forgave in order that you might not grieve for what sent out of your hand and what befell you. And Allah is informed of your doings.",

Allah knows the thoughts of your hearts.",
  "verse_155": "No doubt, those of you who turned back on the day when two armies met. It was Satan who made them slip because of their certain actions, and surely Allah forgave them. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Gentle.",
  "verse_156": "O believers! Be not like those infidels who told about their brothers when went on journey or on holy war; that had they been with us, they would not have died and not been slain, in order that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. And Allah gives life and causes death, and Allah is seeing your works.",
  "verse_157": "And undoubtedly, if you are slain in the way of Allah or die, then the forgiveness of Allah and His mercy are better than their entire wealth.",
  "verse_158": "And if you die or be slain, certainly you are to gather towards Allah.",
  "verse_159": "Then, it is of the mercy of Allah that O beloved! You became gentle for them and if you had been hot-headed, hard hearted, then they certainly would have dispersed from your circle; so pardon them and intercede for them and consult them in the affairs; and when you have made up your mind for anything, then put your trust in Allah. Undoubtedly, the trustful are dear to Allah.",

  "verse_161": "It cannot be thought about any Prophet that he hides away something and whatever he hides away, he shall come with his hidden thing on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and there shall be no unjustice unto them.",

  "verse_167": "And that He might make one to distinguish the hypocrites; and it was said to them, \"Come, fight in the way of Allah or drive out the enemy\". They said, \"If we knew fighting, then certainly we would have sided you.\" And they on that day were nearer to apparent infidelity than to express faith. They say with their mouths, what is not in their hearts. And Allah knows what they are concealing.",
  "verse_168": "Those who said about their brothers and while themselves remained behind, 'Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.' Say you, 'then avert your own death if you are truthful.'",

  "verse_177": "Those who purchased infidelity for faith will not harm Allah at all, and for them is the painful torment.",
  "verse_178": "And let never the unbelievers suppose that respite, We grant them is something good for them. Certainly We grant them respite only because they may further increase in sin. And for them is the degrading torment.",
  "verse_179": "Allah is not to leave the Muslims in the present state of affairs in which you are, until He separates unpure from the pure. And it is not befitting to the dignity of Allah that â€˜O general people! He let you know the unseen. Yes, Allah chooses from amongst His Messengers whom He pleases. Then believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you accept faith and fear, then there is great reward for you.",
  "verse_180": "Andlet not those who are niggardly with respect to what Allah has given them out of His bounty think that it is good for them; on the contrary it is bad for them.

  "verse_184": "Then O beloved! if they belie you even, so the Messengers before you, who had come bearing clear signs and the scriptures and the shining Book have already been belied.",
  "verse_185": "Every soul is to taste the death; and you will get your compensation in full only on the Day of Resurrection. Whosoever is saved from the Fire and made to enter into Paradise, attained to his goal. And the life of this world is but the goods of deception.",
  "verse_186": "Undoubtedly, you shall certainly be tested in your property and in your lives, and undoubtedly, you shall certainly hear a good deal of bad things from the people of the Book before you and from idolaters. But if you endure and guard yourselves (against evils), then it is the work of strong determination.",
  "verse_187": "And remember when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Book that, 'you shall necessarily make it known to the people and conceal it not' but they threw it behind their backs, and took a mean price in exchange of it, then how an evil purchasing it is!",
  "verse_188": "Never think of those who rejoice on their doings and wish that they may be praised without doing. Never think of such people away from the torment; and for them is the painful torment.",

  "verse_195": "Then their Lord heard their prayer, that I certainly waste not the labour of any worker from amongst you, be a male or female, you are one among yourselves. Hence those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes and were tortured in My way and fought and were killed. I shall surely wipe out all their sins and shall surely cause them to enter into the gardens beneath which flow rivers, a reward from Allah. And with Allah only there is good reward.",
  "verse_196": "O listener! Let not deceive you the strutting about of the infidels in the cities.",
  "verse_197": "A brief enjoyment; their abode is the Hell and what an evil bed!",
  "verse_198": "But those who fear their Lord, for them there are gardens beneath which flow rivers. They shall abide therein, an entertainment from Allah and that which is with Allah is still better for the righteous.",
