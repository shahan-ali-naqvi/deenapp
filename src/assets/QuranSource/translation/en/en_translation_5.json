Do not make lawful the symbols of Allah, and nor the sacred months, and nor the sacrifices sent to the Sacred House (Haram), and nor those bearing signs in their necks, and nor the property and honor of those who repair to the sacred House, seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord. And when you put off the pilgrim's garb, then you may hunt. And let not the enmity of any people as they had prevented you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to commit excessiveness. And help each other in righteousness and piety, and help not one another in sin and transgression and remain fearing Allah. Undoubtedly, the torment of Allah is severe.",

This is an act of sin. This day the infidels are despaired of your religion, then fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favor upon you and have chosen Islam as religion for you. But whoso is forced by extreme hunger, thirst without inclining towards sin, then undoubtedly, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",
        "verse_4": "They ask you O beloved Prophet! what has been made lawful to them, say you, 'good and pure things have been made lawful to you and what hunting animals you have trained for hunting, teaching them of what Allah has taught you, then eat of what they leave for you after hunting and pronounce the name of Allah over it, and remain fearing Allah. Undoubtedly, Allah is Swift in taking account.",

They change the words of Allah from their places and have forgotten a good portion of those admonitions which were given to them, and you shall always continue to be told of one or the other of their treachery, save a few of them, so pardon them, and overlook them. Undoubtedly Allah loves the benefactors.",
        "verse_14": "And those who claimed that \"we are Christians,\" We took covenant from them, they too have forgotten a good portion of those admonitions which were given to them, so We have caused enmity and hatred among themselves till the Day of Judgement.

  "verse_32": "On account of this, We wrote for the children of Israel that whosoever killed a soul not to retaliate for a soul, or for creating disorder in the land, then it is as if he had killed all mankind. And whoso gave life to one soul, then it is as if he had given life to all mankind. And undoubtedly, Our Messengers came to them with clear proofs, then undoubtedly, many of them after that commit excesses in the land.",
  "verse_33": "The only recompense of those who fight against Allah and His Messenger and wander about in the land making mischief is this, that they all should be slain or be crucified or their hands of one side and the feet of the other side be cut off or be sent far away from the land. This is their disgrace in the world and in the Hereafter, for them there is great torment.",

They change the words of Allah from their places, and say, 'if you get this command, then accept it, and if you get not this, then be on your guard.' And to whom Allah pleases to misguide, then you shall never be able to avail him anything against Allah. These are they whose hearts Allah intended not to purify. To them there is disgrace in the world, and to them there is great torment in the Hereafter.",
  "verse_42": "They are habitual listeners of lies, great devourers of the things forbidden. So if they come to you, then judge between them or turn your face from them; and if you will turn your face from them, they shall not harm you at all.

So judge you between them according to what Allah has sent down, and O listener! do not follow their desires leaving the truth that has come to you, We ordained a law and way each for all of you, and if Allah had willed, He would have made you all a single people, but He desires to test you in what He has given you. So desire to excel in good deeds. You are all to return towards Allah only, then He shall tell you regarding what you used to dispute.",
  "verse_49": "And that O Muslim! Judge according to what Allah has sent down and follow not their desires and be on guard against them lest they cause to slip you from any command that has come to you.

Their own hands be tied up and there be curse of Allah on them for their utterings, but His hands are wide open, He gives how He pleases. And O beloved Prophet! What has been sent down to you from your Lord will increase many of them in wickedness and infidelity. And We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgement. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it, and run about in the land for mischief. And Allah loves not the mischief-mongers.",
  "verse_65": "And had the people of the Book believed and been duty- bound, then indeed We would have removed their sins and We would surely have caused them to enter gardens of Bliss.",
  "verse_66": "And had they maintained Taurah and Injeel and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, then they would have received subsistence from above and from beneath their feet. A party among them is moderate and most of them are doing most evil things.",
